# TSEChacks
For the TSEC hacks hackathon

A botched up project, ðŸ˜…, but not everything does go to plan all the time and this is an example from 101 Murpphy's law....

Getting to the code, we built this application using HTML, CSS, JS and firebase. We used firebase's real time database to store the user information. 
Google was used for user auth.
